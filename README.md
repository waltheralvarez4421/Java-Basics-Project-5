# Java-Beginner-Project-5

Beginner project completed during my Master's program. 

This program computes the number of words in a string.
It first requests the user input a string without putting a space in the beginning or end,
then it checks to see if the user left the string blank, put a space in the front or the end,
if the string passes all the checks then the countWords method is called to check the amount
of words in the string and returns the quantity to the user.
